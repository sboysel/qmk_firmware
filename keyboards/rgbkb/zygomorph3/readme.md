Documentation is a work in progress.
For now, here are some basics:
* All three slide switches on the back must be in the same direction. Flip them away from the USB port you'll connect to the PC.
* To flash the keyboard, plug the PCB in while holding the BOOT button. Or, while it's plugged in, hold BOOT and tap RESET. Then, drag your .uf2 file into the new file storage device that should pop up.
